# Valuation-of-Players
This is a beginner code the analyze the market value of players in Football Manager 2012, written in Python and executed on the terminal. 
Consists in analyze the age, the actual market value, the years of contract already payedm the potencial and importance to the team. 
Its not based in any knowledge of market and negociations at the area of sports, but its based in my personal feeling about the fair price to sell the players. 
I used the Football Manager version 2012 because I play more than the other versions.
The code is all in portuguese. ;)

UPDATE: 18, june, 2021
I'll rewrite the code to calculate the valuation using multipliers that will give me the final price, based in the market value. This is more precise and works for every market value, removing the 2 milion almost arbitrary added ou subtracted in the code.
